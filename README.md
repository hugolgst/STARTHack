## Synopsis
Homeccenture uses **machine learning** to enlightens your home-office experience by recommending activities.

Being a very intuitive application, it asks you very few questions in order to work. 

Right after answering these question, that's where machine learning takes place. The machine learning recommender system automatically recommends the users new activities from the Company-wise dataset based on their colleague's interactions.

The product would be **owned** by the companies who bought it. It would mean that the companies would have **full control** over their data.
Homeccenture is fully open-source and keeps no trace other than in the server it is hosted.
Homeccenture cares about privacy.
